# QuickLauncher
QuickLauncher is a very simple one-click app designed as a lightweight alternative to my [SPT Launcher](https://github.com/minihazel/SPTMiniLauncher).

## Why?
I always set out to make solutions to make said process or method quicker. When I play, I want to be able to launch the game as quickly as I can without making things too dependent on each other. Alongside that, I'm a huge fan of lightweight little tools that do one thing almost perfectly. This is the result of that idea.

## How do I use it?
- Download the app via the [Releases](https://github.com/minihazel/QuickLauncher/releases) page
- Extract `QuickLauncher.exe` from `QuickLauncher.7z` with [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) into your SPT-AKI folder
- Run the file you extracted
- Select a profile
- Profit

## How does it work?
It lists all the available profiles in your given SPT-AKI installation and lets you hop right into the game with the profile you select. Shrimple ü¶ê as that

## Timeout limit
The timeout limit is the time it takes until the automatic detection disables itself and runs Tarkov manually. It's a failsafe designed to ensure that resources aren't being unnecessarily used.
